# SQL Practice

This repository will contain my personal SQL practice – both general exercises and tasks inspired by the Polish high school final exam in computer science (Matura).

###  Repo structure

- **[/exercises](./excercises)**  
  General SQL exercises based on online tutorials and platforms (e.g. SQLZoo, FreeCodeCamp, HackerRank). I use this folder to practice basic queries like `SELECT`, filtering, sorting, aggregations, joins, and subqueries.

- **[/exam-excercises](./exam-excercises)**  
  Tasks modeled after actual high school final exam questions. Most of them involve working with tables such as students, books, orders, etc. Each file contains one task in `.sql` format with clear comments and structured queries.

- **[/local-db](./local-db)**  
  A small test database I created for personal experimentation.  
  This folder includes:
  - `create_tables.sql` – the schema (table definitions),
  - `insert_data.sql` – sample data to populate the tables,

  This setup allows me to test ideas and reinforce concepts without relying on any online platform.
