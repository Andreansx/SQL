This repository will contain my personal SQL practice â€“ both general exercises and tasks inspired by the Polish high school final exam in computer science (Matura).

###  Repo structure

- **[/exercises](./excercises)**  
  General SQL exercises based on online tutorials, platforms and ChatGPT. I will use this folder to store excercises in which I will practice basic queries like `SELECT`, filtering, sorting, aggregations, joins, and subqueries. 

- **[/exam-excercises](./exam-excercises)**  
  Tasks modeled after actual high school final exam questions. Most of them involve working with tables such as students, books, orders, etc. Each file contains one task in `.sql` format with clear comments and structured queries.

  This setup allows me to test ideas and reinforce concepts without relying on any online platform.
